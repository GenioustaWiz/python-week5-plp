This script first creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" in write mode ('w') and writes three lines of text to the file, including a mix of `strings and numbers`.

Then, it reads the contents of "my_file.txt" and displays them on the `console`.

After that, it opens "my_file.txt" in append mode ('a') and appends three additional lines of text to the existing content.

Finally, it displays the updated file content on the `console`.
